# RF Imaging with PlutoSDR

This project aims to develop a reliable and efficient RF imaging system using PlutoSDR transceivers in Python. It includes a hardware control module and an algorithm for image reconstruction from RF signals.

The hardware control module provides an interface to easily configure the PlutoSDR transceivers and acquire the RF signals. It allows for flexible parameter settings, such as the number of transceivers, which can be adjusted to accommodate different imaging scenarios.

The image reconstruction algorithm takes the acquired RF signals and applies advanced signal processing techniques to reconstruct the underlying image. The algorithm is designed to be computationally efficient and scalable to handle large amounts of data.
